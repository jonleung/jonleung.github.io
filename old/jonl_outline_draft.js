    :Engineering:
      I am studying Computer Engineering 
      at the University of Pennsylvania. 

      This essentially means that I am taking 
      Computer Science & Electrical Engineering 
      classes. 

      I like working with Web as much as I like 
      working with Embedded technologies. 

      I work in Python, Ruby, Java, C, and know the 
      Google App Engine, Django, and Rails platforms

      Here are "some of the things that I have built"
