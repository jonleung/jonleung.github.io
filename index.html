      <p>
        I am a product focused full stack engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about creating powerful yet simple tools that spark joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m becoming fascinated by ways in which we can use machine learning better
        understand ourselves and work with our emotions in real-time. One fantasy of mine
        is to have an incredibly empathetic AI therapist and coach that I can talk to 24/7.

        Previously, I was the sole web engineer at 
        <a href="https://calm.com">Calm</a> when we won Apple's App of the
        Year.  Before that, I was recognized as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/hgdl45ki/jonathan-leung-25-zach/">Forbes 30 Under 30</a> in
        education for co-founding the international tech education
        non-profit, <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied computer engineering at the University of Pennsylvania where I was a lead organizer of
        <a href="https://pennapps.com/">PennApps</a>, the first and largest intercollegiate hackathon in the world. 
      </p>
