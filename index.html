      <p>
        I am a product focused full stack engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about creating powerful yet simple tools that spark joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm starting to explore how we can use ML to better understand ourselves, each other, and our emotions.
        As an example, one fantasy of mine is to have an incredibly empathetic AI therapist and coach that I can talk to 24/7.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, I was the sole web engineer at 
        <a href="https://calm.com">Calm</a> when we won Apple's App of the
        Year.  Before that, I was recognized as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/hgdl45ki/jonathan-leung-25-zach/">Forbes 30 Under 30</a> in
        education for co-founding <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, a non-profit that works with high school students to start coding clubs around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied computer engineering at the University of Pennsylvania where I was an early lead organizer of
        <a href="https://pennapps.com/">PennApps</a>, the first and largest intercollegiate hackathon in the world. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see some of the small & fun projects I've worked on over the years <a href="http://work.jonl.org">here</a>.
